# workshop_clinic
Landing page made with some effort to make it fully responsive.
The project is a result of a workshop in building internet sites.
It is a lading page with little interaction like directing users to other locations on the same page 
when they click main menu as well as basic 'click' events changing colors.
There is also interesting menu effect added.

Two main issues where the stress has been put:
First one is the responsive layout - site should display properly on various devices;
Second one is using SASS properly which includes building partials were needed;
Additionally, I gathered some skills in usinig BEM methodology for naming classes;

'Koala' app was used for SASS compilation to CSS. 
For small projects it is more than enough.
